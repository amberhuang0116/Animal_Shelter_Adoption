# Animal Shelter Adoption
Animal Shelter Adoption Analysis

Animal shelters play an important role in our community as they constantly strive to reunite pets with their owners. Itâ€™s often a thankless job for the shelters as they balance housing the animals, encouraging and promoting pet adoptions and motivating people to responsibly spay and neuter their pets with limited resources. An average of 6.3 million companion animals enter U.S shelters each year, out of which 2.7 million are humanely killed due to overcrowding. Our goal is to analyze the animal shelter data and create awareness to more effectively help respond to and identify the animals that need more support to avoid unwanted outcomes.
